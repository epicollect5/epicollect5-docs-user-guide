# Mobile App Authentication

For enhanced security within our mobile app, only one device can be authenticated at a time. This means that if you log in to the app on one mobile device, and then log in on another mobile device, the first device will be automatically logged out.

For example, if you log in to the app on your smartphone (Device A) while at home, and then later log in on your tablet (Device B), the app on your smartphone will be logged out to ensure that only one mobile device remains authenticated.

However, web access is not affected by this restriction. You can still access your account through the web on your computer or other devices simultaneously, even if you're logged in to the mobile app on one device. This allows you to maintain access to your account on both your mobile app and the web without interruption.
