# Entries Limits

If you are collecting data for a project where the manager(s) set entry limits, you might get some errors when trying to upload entries. [More on setting entries limits](entries-limits.md)**.**

For example, let's have a look at our example project [EC5 Limit entries.](https://five.epicollect.net/project/ec5-limit-entries)

On the [EC5 Limit entries](https://five.epicollect.net/project/ec5-limit-entries) project, we set the limits of the PERSON form to 2.&#x20;

We already uploaded 2 entries to the server for the PERSON form, so let's see what happens if you try to add an extra entry.

The upload attempt failed, as the entries limit on the server is reached.

If you download the entries from the server, they count towards the entries limit therefore the **+ADD ENTRY** button gets disabled.
