# Filter Entries

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently Android only, from app version 3.0.0 onwards.
{% endhint %}

Entries can be filtered on the mobile app.

&#x20;The filter controls are disabled by default as they might clutter the interface on small devices or they might not be needed when collecting data.

### Enable filters
