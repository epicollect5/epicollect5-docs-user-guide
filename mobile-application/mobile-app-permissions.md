# Mobile App Permissions

1. **Camera Access**: Epicollect5 requires access to your device's camera to capture photos directly within the app. This is crucial for users who need to document their observations or collect visual data as part of their project.
2. **Location Access**: To accurately record the coordinates of your device, Epicollect5 requests location permissions. This ensures that the geographic data collected is precise, enabling users to map data points effectively in their research or fieldwork.
3. **Microphone Access**: The app uses the microphone to record audio, which is vital for capturing voice notes or other audio data as part of your project. This functionality is particularly useful in scenarios where verbal descriptions or interviews need to be documented.
4. **Storage and Media Access**: Epicollect5 needs access to your device's storage to save photos and videos or to allow you to select media files from your existing library. This ensures that your visual data is easily accessible and can be incorporated into your data collection efforts seamlessly.
5. **Notifications**: To enhance user experience and ensure smooth operation, Epicollect5 sends notifications when you take a photo or scan a barcode. This is particularly important on devices with aggressive Android ROMs or battery optimization settings that might otherwise kill the app. The notification acts as a safeguard, keeping the app running in the background while you continue your data collection tasks uninterrupted.

**Important Settings Recommendations**

To ensure that Epicollect5 operates smoothly and reliably, we recommend that you:

* **Disable Auto-Removal of Permissions**: Some devices have a setting that automatically removes permissions if an app hasnâ€™t been used for a certain period. Please ensure this setting is turned off for Epicollect5. This will prevent the app from losing necessary permissions unexpectedly, ensuring that it remains fully functional whenever you need it.
* **Disable Battery Optimization**: Many devices have battery optimization settings that can restrict the background activity of apps. For Epicollect5 to function correctly, especially during tasks like photo-taking or barcode scanning, make sure to disable any battery optimization settings that could interfere with its operation. This will help maintain the app's performance and prevent it from being closed or restricted by the system.

These permissions and settings are crucial for Epicollect5 to function as a comprehensive data collection tool, offering you the flexibility and reliability needed for successful field research. Rest assured, each permission is used solely to enhance the app's performance and to support your data collection activities.
