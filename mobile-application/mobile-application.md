## Media files

### Photos

Photos taken/imported to Epicollect5 will be resized to a resolution of **1024 x 768 px** (landscape or portrait, **aspect ratio 4:3**).

We found this size to be reasonable for data collection purposes, it is stable across devices with low memory/specs and easily viewable via the web application. Due to modern devices taking pictures at crazy resolutions and with file sizes up to 20MB we had to come up with a consistent solution.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want the original, full size image we recommend taking the photos outside of Epicollect5, then import them in Epicollect5 using the image picker when adding an entry. That way the original photo is saved in the device gallery app.
{% endhint %}

As a side note, the popular app [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/?hl=en) does use a similar approach.

As technology evolves, we might raise the resolution limits at some point in the future.

### Audio

Audio files are stored as .`mp4` on Android and `.wav` on iOS.

They are coded as **AAC** with **44100hz** audio sampling.

Max file size is 100MB.

### Video

Video file are stored as `.mp4` files, coded as **h.264 on iOS**, on **Android it depends on platform and device**, but it is sent always as a `mp4` file.

Max file size is 500MB.
