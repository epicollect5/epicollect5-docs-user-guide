A confirmation prompt is shown. Tap **OK** to confirm or **CANCEL** to dismiss the popup.

**Be careful to sync your entries first!**

You will not lose data from the main server/database if you delete entries from your mobile device, provided that:

* The entries were uploaded successfully without any errors.
* You have double-checked that the entries are all uploaded on the server (in the web interface).
* (Optional, but extra safe!) You have downloaded a CSV backup from the server to keep a local copy.

If you have confirmed your data is on the server, you can safely delete the entries from your phone. The server and the app are independent once the upload is complete and confirmed.

All the entries get deleted, and a "**No Entries Found**" message is displayed.

To delete a single entry, tap on the entry to view it and use the **DELETE** button at the top right.
