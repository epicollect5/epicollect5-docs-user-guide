# View Projects

After you create a project, you are redirected to the project "details" page, containing all the information about your project.

Your project home page URL will be at the top:

![](../.gitbook/assets/view-project-1.png)

It is usually like [https://five.epicollect.net/project/my-awesome-project](https://five.epicollect.net/project/my-awesome-project)

The last part `/my-awesome-project` is your project slug. A project slug is a web-friendly version of your project name, where all the spaces are converted to dashes (`-`) and the letters are all lowercase. This is a convention for URLs all over the web. Since each project gets its own URL, **your project name cannot be the same** as any other projects on Epicollect5.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Projects with the **EC5** prefix are projects created by the Epicollect5 Team only therefore the prefix **EC5** is reserved.
{% endhint %}

Going to your project homepage, this is how it would look like:

![](../.gitbook/assets/view-project-2.png)

At a glance, you can see:

* Your project logo
* Your project's small description
* Approximated total of entries collected\*
* Date of last entry uploaded
* Your project's full description

{% hint style="warning" %}
The "**â‰ˆ" (tilde) sign** shown on the project homepage indicates that the entry count is **approximate**. This is intentional, as showing an exact number on the homepage for every project would place unnecessary load on the system.&#x20;

For the **precise count of entries**, please check the **Data Viewer**, which always displays the actual number of records uploaded at the top right.
