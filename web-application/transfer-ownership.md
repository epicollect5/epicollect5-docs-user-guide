# Transfer Ownership

A project CREATOR **can transfer the ownership of a project** to one of its MANAGER(s) and become a MANAGER himself.

The newly assigned CREATOR can then remove the old one (now a MANAGER) at any time.

Go to the project details page and click on "Manage Users":

Select a MANAGER from the list and click on "CONFIRM":

{% hint style="warning" %}
Remember you MUST have at least one MANAGER.
{% endhint %}

You are now a MANAGER.
