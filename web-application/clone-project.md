# Clone Project

Sometimes you have a project you would like to copy and just do some tweaking instead of creating a new one from scratch.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Cloning will perform a copy of the project definition, the mapping, and (optional) the users of a project.

**Data are not copied**.
{% endhint %}

On the project details page, just click on "Clone"

![](../.gitbook/assets/clone-1.png)

Type a name for the cloned project and click clone.

There is also the option to clone all the users of the original project.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware cloned projects are always assigned to the original CREATOR(s) of a project.&#x20;

If you would like to use someone else's project as a template please have a look at [**how to export and import projects.**](import-and-export-projects.md)
{% endhint %}
