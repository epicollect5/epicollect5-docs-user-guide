# Rename Projects

Unfortunately, a project cannot be renamed directly.

You could [**clone your project** ](clone-project.md)and give the cloned one a different name, then delete the old one.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Be aware: data will NOT be ported over.**&#x20;

Make a backup of your data before deleting a project.
{% endhint %}
