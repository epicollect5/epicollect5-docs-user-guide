### Error Code 1 (Mobile apps)

**Current Status:**

* We are actively monitoring these occurrences and testing various potential workarounds.
* Unfortunately, due to the sporadic nature of the issue and our inability to consistently reproduce it on our test devices, pinpointing the exact cause has been challenging.

**Temporary Solution:**

* If you encounter this error, we recommend uninstalling and then reinstalling the application. This has been effective for many users and may resolve the problem on your device.

**Next Steps:**
