# Intro

Epicollect5 provides an API to fetch data programmatically using some simple GET requests.

Responses are in `JSON` (default) or `CSV` format.

For simple uses, we provide you with the parameters and some pre-made endpoints to view in your browser (**public projects only**). **** [**More info**](api.md)**.**

{% hint style="warning" %}
For private projects, you'll need to register your app before getting started.&#x20;

A registered app is assigned a unique Client ID and Client Secret which will be used in the OAuth flow.&#x20;

**The Client Secret must not be shared!**
{% endhint %}
