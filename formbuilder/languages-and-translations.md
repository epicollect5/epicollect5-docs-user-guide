# Languages and Translations

#### Forms and Data Collection

You are welcome to use any UTF-8 language for your forms. This flexibility allows you to create and manage forms in a wide range of languages.

#### Mobile App User Interface

The user interface (UI) of the mobile app has been translated into the following languages:

* **English**
* **Italian**
* **French**
* **Spanish**
* **Polish**
* **Portuguese**
* **Catalan**

If you are using a language other than the ones listed above, please note the following:

* **Form Questions**: The questions and content within your forms will be displayed in the language you have selected.
* **UI Elements**: Despite the form translations, the buttons, labels, and other UI elements of the mobile app will still appear in English.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The app's language is not manually set. If your phone uses a language other than English and a translation is available, the app's UI will automatically display in that language. Please note that only the app's buttons and labels will be translated; your forms and questions will remain in the language you originally wrote them in.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Contributing Translations

If you notice that your preferred language is not yet supported in the mobile app or if you would like to contribute translations for a missing language, we welcome your contributions!

#### Where to Find Language Files

To access and translate the language files for the mobile app, [**please visit this repository**](https://github.com/epicollect5/epicollect5-language-files). The files are organized and available for you to translate into your desired language, and instructions are provided.&#x20;
