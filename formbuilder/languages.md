# Languages

You can use any UTF-8 language in your forms. The full list is [**here.**](http://www.unicode.org/standard/supported.html)

The mobile app UI instead is translated in the following languages:

* English
* Italian
* French
* Spanish
* Polish

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are using a different language from the ones above, the mobile app questions will be in that language but the mobile app buttons and labels will still be in English.&#x20;

If you are willing to provide a missing translation for the mobile app, [l**et us know**](https://spectrum.chat/epicollect5)**.**

The language files to translate are hosted [**here.**](https://github.com/epicollect5/epicollect5-language-files/tree/main)
