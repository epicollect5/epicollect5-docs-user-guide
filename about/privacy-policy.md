Epicollect5 embraces industry-standard best practices to protect against unauthorised access to your data.

Data are sent over [**HTTPS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS) and its TLS certificate uses SHA-256 with RSA encryption as a signature algorithm.

Epicollect5 mobile app data stored on the device is not encrypted by default but if that extra level of security is needed, any recent Android and iOS device can be encrypted system-wide. [**Read how to do it**](https://gizmodo.com/why-you-should-be-encrypting-your-devices-and-how-to-ea-1798698901).

Daily backups of the server are run in case of a system fault.
