# What is Epicollect5

[**Epicollect5**](https://five.epicollect.net/) is a mobile & web application for free and easy data collection developed by the [**CGPS Team**](https://www.pathogensurveillance.net/our-software/)**.**

{% hint style="success" %}
Try our new app for [Android](https://appdistribution.firebase.dev/i/8abab31013254ea2) & [iOS](https://testflight.apple.com/join/XbAmIp12). Thank you in advance ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ’»
{% endhint %}

It provides both web and mobile applications for the generation of forms (questionnaires) and freely hosted project websites for data collection.&#x20;

Projects are created by using the web application at [**five.epicollect.net**](https://five.epicollect.net) ([**see how to create a project**](web-application/create-a-project.md)) and then downloaded to the device to perform the data collection ([**see how to add a project to the mobile app**](mobile-application/add-projects.md)).

Data are collected (including GPS and media) using multiple devices and all data can be viewed on a central server (via map, tables, and charts).

Data can be exported in `csv` and `json` format

The mobile app is available for both Android (10+) and iOS (13+)

**Epicollect5 is 100% free to use without any limits(\*)**. You can create as many projects and upload as many entries as you wish.&#x20;

Epicollect5 is financially supported by the [Wellcome Trust Foundation](https://wellcome.ac.uk/) and we implement open-source technologies to be able to provide the service for free.

{% hint style="warning" %}
(\*)Please be aware a fair usage policy still applies. For example, if you upload 500 videos at 500MB each that will be 250GB of storage, which is too much.&#x20;

While nothing stops you from doing that, our resources are limited and Epicollect5 is not a free storage solution.
